<h2 id="why-the-date-april-6th">Why the date April 6th?</h2>
<p>The date was chosen by an international committee to avoid clashes with
other significant dates around the world and to fit in with the
constraints of the participating organisations as far as possible. No
date is perfect, and we apologise if the date isn’t ideal for you. We
will review the date after the first year.</p>
<p>April 6th will sometimes fall during Autism Awareness Week, and that’s
something we’re aware of. The first time this will occur is 2024. We
welcome feedback from the autistic community, especially autistic aces,
about our choice of date and if it’s not suitable, we’ll find a new date
going forward.</p>
<h2 id="who-organises-this-event">Who organises this event?</h2>
<p>The event does not belong to one particular organisation, being a
collaboration between different international ace groups, who will each
take charge of local events in their respective countries</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-international-asexuality-day">Why do we need International Asexuality Day?</h2>
<p>The day is designed to complement other ace events like Ace Week (the
last week in October), but with a special emphasis on the international
community, going beyond the anglophone and Western sphere that has so
far had the most coverage.</p>
<p>The day can also serve as a focal point for giving asexuality some
visibility in the first half of the year, useful for countries for which
the end of October (Ace Week) is a difficult time of year for ace
advocacy.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-my-organisation-get-involved">How can my organisation get involved?</h2>
<p>If you are part of an ace organisation who is not already part of IAD,
we would love to have you! Contact us, and join in. Even if your group
is very small, you are welcome and IAD is all about larger groups with a
bigger platform helping the smaller ones to be heard.</p>
<p>There are no groups in my country. Can I still participate?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Look out for online events held by the groups in other
countries. Look at social media for posts that you can share to help
spread awareness of what is happening in ace communities around the
world. Use the day to advocate, celebrate, educate and show solidarity
in your own way - whatever that looks like.</p>
